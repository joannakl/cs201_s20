# Prerequisites
---

**Passing CSCI.UA.0102 with a grade of C or better.**
You are expected to know and remember the material from CSCI.UA.0101 and CSCI.UA.0102 courses.


# Grading
---

Your grade will be based on:

* exams (65%): online test (5%), midterm exam (20%) and the final (40%),  
* projects (25% total)
* recitation activities (5% total) <br>
  activities will be completed during recitations - you will not get credit for these unless you are in the recitation session <br>
  three lowest recitation scores will be dropped at the end of the semester
* quizzes (5% total) <br>
  pop-quizzes will be given during lectures and will **not be announced** - no make-up quizzes will be given  <br>
  two lowest quiz scores will be dropped at the end of the semester

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A 	95-100
        A- 	90-95
        B+ 	87-90
        B 	83-87
        B- 	80-83
        C+ 	76-80
        C 	72-76
        D 	65-72
        F 	less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.


# Absences (excused and unexcused)
---

I generally do not take attendance.

__The missed quizzes and recitation activities cannot be made up__. Three lowest scores on recitation activities and two lowest scores on quizzes will be dropped at the end of the
semester. This is to account for any excused and unexcused absences.

The exams can be made up only in case of an excused absence with appropriate documentation.

If you will miss an exam due to a religious observance, please familiarize yourself with [University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays](https://goo.gl/e6NHDe) and talk to me well in advance to come up with alternative arrangements.

# Recitations
---

Recitations for the course are used to answer your questions regarding the material and posted homeworks/projects. During recitations you will also get some hands on practice by participating in activities (you can complete them individually or in small groups).

You should be bringing your computer to the recitations. Make sure its fully charged since the room does not have many outlets.


# Projects
---
Projects will be given on a regular basis. In general, they will be due one-two weeks after they are assigned. They will require you to write and, often, read significant amount of code (C and assembly).

_No projects can be accepted after the last day of classes._

__Late and missed projects:__
For each project you will have a 5 hour buffer window after the due date. You can submit or resubmit the project during this time without any point penalty.
The late project submissions lose 20% of their value for each day they are late. If you submit the project 5-24 hours late, the late penalty is 20 points. If you submit the project 24-48 hours late, the point penalty is 40 points, etc.

# Exams
---
There will be an in-class midterm exam and an in-class final exam (during the time allocated by CAS).
There will also be an online test at the first part of the semester. All exams are cumulative.

__Missing an exam:__ There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for students who have a legitimate medical or personal emergency (documented). These students need to talk to the instructor as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam absence a week after it happened will not work).


# Academic Integrity Policy
---

I use [MOSS](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)
(a system for detecting software plagiarism) to make sure that the
submitted assignments are not duplicates of one another. Your code
has to be your own.


I follow the department's
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity).

In short, it is fine to talk to other students about your ideas and your
programs, but it is not fine to work together on
assignments or copy someone else's assignment. You cannot copy other people's
work without giving them a proper credit (and
part of your grade).<br>
Any sharing or copying of assignments will be considered cheating.
By the rules of the College of Arts and Science, I am required to report any incidents of cheating to the department. <br>
If you have any doubt if something that you are doing qualifies as academic dishonesty, talk to me!
<br>

*So what is cheating?*

* Sharing code/solutions: by copying, retyping, looking at, or supplying a file (this includes posting partial or
complete solutions on the course discussion board, a public repository - think GitHub, or any place where others can access it)
* Coaching: helping your friend to write their code line by line (send
them to the tutors or office hours, if you want to help them)
* Copying code from previous course or from elsewhere on WWW.
    You are only allowed to use code from the textbook and what we supply on the course website.
* Hiring someone to complete your assignments for you.


*What is NOT cheating?*

* Explaining how to use systems or tools
* Helping others with high-level design issue

# Academic Email Etiquette
---

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.

* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
